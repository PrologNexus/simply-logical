The predicates for user-interaction `nl_shell/1` and `handle_input/2` are mutually recursive. This might cause memory problems in longer sessions. Rewrite the interactive loop into a so-called *failure-driven loop*:
```pProlog
shell:-repeat,get_input(X),handle_input(X).
handle_input(stop):-!.
handle_input(X):- /* do something */,fail.
```
`handle_input/1` is now a predicate which always fails, unless the loop should be terminated. Upon its failure, the first clause will backtrack to `repeat`, which is a built-in predicate which succeeds an indefinite number of times. Thus, `get_input/1` will again be called.  
(NB. Since it is impossible to pass arguments on to the next iteration, the changes to the rulebase have to be made through side-effects, i.e. by means of `assert/1` and `retract/1`.)
