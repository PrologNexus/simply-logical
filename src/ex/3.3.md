Draw the SLD-tree for the query {swish-query}`?-likes(A,B) <swishq:3.2.ex3.3_2>`, given the following program:
```{swish} swish:3.2.ex3.3_2
---
query-id: swishq:3.2.ex3.3_2
---
```
Add a cut in order to prune away one of the answers { `A` &rarr; `peter`, `B` &rarr; `maria` }, and indicate the result in the SLD-tree. Can this be done without pruning away the third answer?
